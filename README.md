# Boston Crime Data Analysis Dashboard
This project presents an interactive dashboard and visualizations for exploring and analyzing Boston crime data. The goal is to identify trends, spatial concentrations, and temporal patterns in criminal activity across the city. This dashboard helps pinpoint when and where crime is most prevalent.

### Key Features:

- Geographic Analysis: The interactive map visualizes the geographic concentration of crimes with heatmap and colored markers that suggest the offense type.

- Metrics: Displays key statistics like - 1. Total Crimes, 2. Crimes involving shooting, 3. the Peak Day, and 4. the Peak Hour.

- Offense Breakdown: Bar chart detailing 40+ offense types, with different colors for each, indicating the most frequent to the least frequent crimes.

- Time Analysis: A heatmap shows the distribution of crime counts across all 24 hours of the day and all 7 days of the week.

### Technologies used:

- I have used R, Shiny, ggplot2, leaflet and HTML/JS to create custom widgets.
